## `.img-responsive` should only be used on `<img>`s

The `.img-responsive` class is only meant for use on `<img>` elements. Using it on other elements is nonsensical.

Wrong:
```html
<div class="img-responsive">
  <img src="foo.jpg" />
</div>
```

Right:
```html
<div>
  <img src="foo.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
</div>
```
