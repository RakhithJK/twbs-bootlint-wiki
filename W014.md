## Carousel controls and indicators should use `href` or `data-target` to reference an element with class `.carousel`.

For proper processing of click events within a carousel each anchor within `.carousel-control` should include either a `href` or `data-target` attribute with the ID of the corresponding element within the carousel.

Wrong:
```html
<a class="right carousel-control" role="button" data-slide="next">
```

Right:
```html
<a class="right carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" role="button" data-slide="next">
```

Also Right:
```html
<a class="right carousel-control" data-target="#carousel-example-generic" role="button" data-slide="next">
```
