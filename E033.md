## `.alert` with dismiss button must have class `.alert-dismissible`

For a `data-dismiss="alert"` alert dismissal button to work properly, the `.alert` must have the `.alert-dismissible` class.

Wrong:
```html
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  Better check yourself, you're not looking too good.
  <button type="button" data-dismiss="alert">Dismiss</button>
</div>
```

Right:
```html
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible" role="alert">
  Better check yourself, you're not looking too good.
  <button type="button" data-dismiss="alert">Dismiss</button>
</div>
```
