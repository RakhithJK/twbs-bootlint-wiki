## Always set a `type` on `<button>`s.

If a `<button>` lacks a `type` attribute, it defaults to being a `type="submit"` button, which will cause it to, when clicked, submit any form it's associated with. This behavior is often not desired, so it's best to be explicit about the `type` of all your `<button>`s. Valid `type`s are: `type="button"`, `type="submit"`, and `type="reset"` .
