## `.col-*-12` classes used alone are not useful.

The contained elements do not need to be in a row/column at all since it will render the same way without using the grid in the first place. Using a combination of grid classes that includes a `.col-*-12` is ok.

Wrong:

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Content here</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Right:

```html
<p>Content here</p>
```

Another example:

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-12">
        <p>This is fine since it also uses other grid sizes</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
