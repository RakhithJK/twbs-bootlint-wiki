## Tooltips and popovers within button groups should have their `container` set to `'body'`. Found tooltips/popovers that might lack this setting.

When using tooltips or popovers on elements within a `.btn-group`, you'll have to specify the option `container: 'body'` to avoid unwanted side effects (such as the element growing wider and/or losing its rounded corners when the tooltip or popover is triggered).

One way to ensure that this option is set is to add a `data-container="body` attribute to elements within a `.btn-group` that have either a `data-toggle="tooltip"` or `data-toggle="popover"` attribute.
