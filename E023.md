### `.panel-body` must have a `.panel` or `.panel-collapse` parent

A `.panel-body` must be a direct child of its `.panel` or `.panel-collapse`. No levels of intervening elements are permitted between the `.panel-body` and the `.panel` or `.panel-collapse`.

  <div class="my-super-special-wrapper">
    <div class="panel-body">
      Basic panel example
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

    Basic panel example
  </div>
</div>
```
