## Bootstrap version might be outdated. Latest version is at least A.B.C ; saw what appears to be usage of Bootstrap X.Y.Z

Based on the version of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins or based on the apparent version number in the URL of a Bootstrap-related `<script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag, it appears that you are using a version of Bootstrap older than what the latest version of Bootstrap was when your version of Bootlint was released.

This check is heuristic and thus can have false positives or negatives depending on what URLs you're using for Bootstrap or for Bootstrap-related third-party libraries.
