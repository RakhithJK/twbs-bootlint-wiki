We recommend using the simplified HTML5 `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration on your Bootstrapped webpages. See also: [Bootstrap's basic HTML template](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template)

## Document is missing a DOCTYPE declaration

The (X)HTML document seems to not have any [`DOCTYPE` declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration); this can trigger [*quirks mode*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode), which is **not supported by Bootstrap** and can cause the document to render strangely.

## Document declares a non-HTML5 DOCTYPE

The (X)HTML document has a [`DOCTYPE` declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration), but it's not an [HTML5 `DOCTYPE`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype). This can potentially cause problems, especially if you're trying to use HTML5 features. **Bootstrap's documentation assumes that you're using HTML5.**
