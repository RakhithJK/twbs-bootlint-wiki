## Using empty spacer columns isn't necessary with Bootstrap's grid.

Instead of using an empty column just to occupy space and push the next column further to the right, you can just use Bootstrap's [`.col-*-offset-*` classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-offsetting).

Wrong:
```html
<div class="col-xs-3"><!--spacer--></div>
<div class="col-xs-9">...</div>
```

Right:
```html
<div class="col-xs-offset-3 col-xs-9">...</div>
```

To achieve horizontal alignment there you have additional classes at your disposal in Bootstrap 4 and newer. Also there are classes (margin utilities) which help you with moving sibling columns away from one another.
