## Detected what appears to be Bootstrap v4 or later. This version of Bootlint only supports Bootstrap v3.

Based on the version of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins or based on the apparent version number in the URL of a Bootstrap-related `<script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag, it appears that you are using version 4 of Bootstrap. Bootlint only supports version 3.

This check is heuristic and thus can have false positives or negatives depending on what URLs you're using for Bootstrap or for Bootstrap-related third-party libraries.
