## Glyphicon classes must only be used on elements that contain no text content and have no child elements.

Glyphicon classes only work properly on elements that contain no text content and have no child elements. Which is to say that the `.glyphicon` element must be completely empty.

Move any text or child elements outside of the `.glyphicon` element.

Wrong:
```html
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"><a href="#love">I love this</a></span>
```

Right:
```html
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span> <a href="#love">I love this</a>
```
