## Found one or more modals using the deprecated `remote` option

The `remote` option of the Modal plugin is deprecated since Bootstrap v3.2.1 and will be removed in Bootstrap v4. We recommend instead using client-side templating or a data binding framework, or calling [`jQuery.load`](http://api.jquery.com/load/) yourself.
