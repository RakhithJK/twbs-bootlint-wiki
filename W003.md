## `<head>` is missing viewport `<meta>` tag that enables responsiveness

To enable responsive viewport sizing in most modern mobile browsers, the webpage needs to include an appropriate [`<meta name="viewport">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) in its `<head>`, such as:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Bootlint didn't find such a `<meta name="viewport">` tag in the webpage. Unless you're [using Bootstrap in a non-responsive fashion](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#disable-responsive), you should add the tag.
