## `<head>` is missing X-UA-Compatible `<meta>` tag that disables old IE compatibility modes

Bootstrap is not supported in the old Internet Explorer compatibility modes. To be sure you're using the latest rendering mode for IE, we strongly recommend including the appropriate `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` of your pages:

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
```
