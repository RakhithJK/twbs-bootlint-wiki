## Modal markup should not be placed within other components, so as to avoid the component's styles interfering with the modal's appearance or functionality

As noted [in the Modal plugin's documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals):
> Always try to place a modal's HTML code in a top-level position in your document to avoid other components affecting the modal's appearance and/or functionality.

Which is to say that the `<div class="modal">` should not be buried within the markup for another component, such as a `<table>` (which is known to be particularly problematic). It should be a child of the `<body>` or of a relatively high-level division of your webpage.
