## Found one or more uses of outdated Bootstrap v2 `.spanN` grid classes

Bootlint is only compatible with Bootstrap v3.x.x, but it found some uses of [Bootstrap v2.x.x's grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem) classes (`.span1` thru `.span12`) in your document.

You should upgrade to Bootstrap v3 and [its grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid), or stop using Bootlint.
